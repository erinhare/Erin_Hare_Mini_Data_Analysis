### Stat 545A Mini Data Analysis Project

The cancer_sample dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository is used in this repository to complete Milestone 1 and 2 for the STAT 545A Mini Data Analysis Project. 

This repository contains a **Milestone 1** folder which contains a README.md file, mini-project-1_files folder, a mini-project-1.md file, and a mini-project-1.Rmd file.

The **Milestone 2** folder contains a README.md file, mini-project-2_files folder, a mini-project-2.md file, and a mini-project-2.Rmd file.

The **Output** folder contains a README.md file, an area_worst_range.csv file, and a concave_points_mean_lm.rds file which were generated in Milestone 2.

Each folder's README.md file further describes the contents of the folder. 

The code in the Rmd documents and the rds file contents can be run using R. R version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23) and RStudio 2022.07.1 were used.
